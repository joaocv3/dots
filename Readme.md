# Dots

If you are unsure about how to setup your environment, this is a good start.

Here you will find reasonable setup for *git*, *ag*, *ctags*, *fish*, *gem*, *inputrc*, *irb*, *iterm* and *tmux*.
You will also find some scripts to setup a Mac for development (apps, keyboard config, etc) and applications in general.

I hope you enjoy :)
